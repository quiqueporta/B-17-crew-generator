A `go` script to generate the B-17 Queen of the skies crew, a great solo board game.

The crew names are randomly generated from this page [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me)

You can download the `print a play` version from the [Felipe Santamar√≠a webpage](https://sites.google.com/site/felisan88/b-17queenoftheskies).

# Usage
```go
go run main.go
```
This command generates a `B-17_crew.pdf` file with the B-17 crew.

Also you can run a HTTP server to generate the PDF.
```go
go run http/main.go
```
Then you can access to http://localhost:8080 to get the PDF.
